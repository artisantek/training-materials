# JFrog Artifactory Integration with Jenkins

JFrog Artifactory is a universal artifact repository manager that supports all major package formats and integrates seamlessly with Jenkins for automated build and deployment workflows.

## What is JFrog Artifactory?

JFrog Artifactory is a repository manager that serves as a central hub for storing, managing, and distributing software artifacts. It acts as a proxy, cache, and hosting repository for various package types.

### Key Benefits
- **Universal Support** - Supports 30+ package types (Maven, npm, Docker, PyPI, etc.)
- **High Availability** - Enterprise-grade reliability and performance
- **Security** - Fine-grained access controls and vulnerability scanning
- **Build Integration** - Deep integration with CI/CD tools like Jenkins
- **Metadata Management** - Rich metadata and search capabilities

## Installing JFrog Artifactory with Docker Compose

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Minimum 4GB RAM available
- 50GB+ disk space for artifacts

### Step 1: Download JFrog Artifactory OSS

1. **Download the Docker Compose package**
   ```bash
   wget https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/bintray-artifactory/org/artifactory/oss/docker/jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]/jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-compose.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Extract the package**
   ```bash
   # Replace [RELEASE] with the latest version (e.g., 7.111.11)
   tar -xzf jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-compose.tar.gz
   cd artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]
   ```

### Step 2: Run Installation Script

1. **Execute the configuration script**
   ```bash
   sudo ./config.sh
   ```

2. **Follow the installation prompts**
   ```
   Are you adding an additional node to an existing product cluster? [y/N]: n
   
   The installer can install a PostgreSQL database, or you can connect to an existing compatible PostgreSQL database
   (https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/requirements-matrix)
   If you are upgrading from an existing installation, select N if you have externalized PostgreSQL, select Y if not.
   Do you want to install PostgreSQL? [Y/n]: y
   ```

   > **Note**: Selecting 'y' for PostgreSQL will install and configure a PostgreSQL database container

### Step 3: Start Artifactory

1. **Start the services using Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -p rt up -d
   ```

2. **Access Artifactory**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://<ip>:8082`
   - Default credentials: `admin/password`
   - Change the default password on first login

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps
```

## Artifactory Concepts

### Repository Types

<div align="center">
  <img src="../images/jfrog/artifactory_create_repo.png" alt="Creating Artifactory Repository" width="800" />
</div>

#### Local Repositories
Store artifacts built by your organization or uploaded manually.

#### Remote Repositories
Proxy and cache external repositories (Maven Central, npm registry, etc.)

#### Virtual Repositories
Aggregate multiple repositories under a single URL

### Common Repository Examples

When setting up Artifactory, these repositories are typically created automatically or commonly configured:

#### Maven Repositories
- **libs-release-local** - Release versions of internal libraries
- **libs-snapshot-local** - Snapshot/development versions
- **libs-release** - Virtual repository combining local and remote releases
- **repo1-cache** - Cache for Maven Central repository

#### Docker Repositories  
- **docker-local** - Internal Docker images
- **docker-remote** - Proxy for Docker Hub
- **docker** - Virtual repository for all Docker images

#### npm Repositories
- **npm-local** - Internal npm packages
- **npm-remote** - Proxy for npm registry
- **npm** - Virtual repository for npm packages

#### Generic Repositories
- **generic-local** - Generic artifacts (ZIP, TAR, etc.)
- **releases** - Release artifacts
- **snapshots** - Development artifacts

## Setting Up JFrog Integration

### Prerequisites
1. JFrog Artifactory instance running and accessible
2. JFrog Artifactory plugin installed in Jenkins
3. Valid Artifactory credentials

### Step 1: Install JFrog Artifactory Plugin

1. **Navigate to Plugin Manager**
   ```
   Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available
   ```

2. **Search and Install**
   - Search for "Artifactory"
   - Install "Artifactory" plugin
   - Restart Jenkins if required

### Step 2: Configure Artifactory Server

<div align="center">

</div>

1. **Navigate to System Configuration**
   ```
   Manage Jenkins → Configure System → JFrog
   ```

2. **Add Artifactory Server**
   - **Server ID**: `jfrog` (used in pipeline)
